# Randochoose Mobile

This is basically Randochoose but for Android.

## Requirements

It only works on Android 11 or above; I couldn't even get it to work on Android 9. Sorry.

## Why isn't it on Google Play?

It's too unfinished, that's why.

## Installation

Just download the APK file and install it. That's it!

## Contributing

You need to have Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and Xamarin installed if you want to work on the program itself. It's written in C# and XAML.

If you aren't that type who makes software, you can still work on it by
- Translating into other languages
- Working on documentation
- Designing concepts
