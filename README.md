# Randochoose Mobile

This is basically Randochoose but for Android.

## We're Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open issue](https://github.com/Tech-FZ/RandochooseMobile/issues/1) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please 
contact me at lucien-rowan#1916 on Discord so we can find a solution together.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

## Requirements

It only works on Android 11 or above; I couldn't even get it to work on Android 9. Sorry.

## Why isn't it on Google Play?

It's too unfinished, that's why.

## Installation

Just download the APK file and install it. That's it!

## Contributing

You need to have Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and Xamarin installed if you want to work on the program itself. It's written in C# and XAML.

If you aren't that type who makes software, you can still work on it by
- Translating into other languages
- Working on documentation
- Designing concepts
